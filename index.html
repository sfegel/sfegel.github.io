            <h1>About Stephanie...</h1>
            <p> My name is Stephanie Fegel. I am a sophomore English major at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I am originally from the Bronx, New York. I am interested in reading and writing, as well as a career in the legal field. I am expected to graduate with a Bachelor's in English in 2027. I hope to attend law school after graduation. 
            </p>
            <p>I am also a member of Alpha Chi Omega Fraternity. I got initiated in November of 2023, making myself a lifetime member. I am now the Vice President of New Member Education. I oversee the new member process, making sure everything runs smoothly. I hold weekly new member meetings to check in with them and teach them about the history of the organization. I also organize Bid Day, creating a welcoming environment for the first time our new members meet the rest of the chapter.</p>
            <p>On a more personal level, my hobbies include swimming and dancing. I grew up as a competitive dancer so I try to do my best to keep up with it, as it is still one of my passions. I also like to stay in shape through swimming laps at my local pool. </p>
            <p>To learn more about me and my work, please feel free to continue exploring this website! </p>
