            <h1>Get to know Stephanie...</h1>
            <h2>About me...</h2>
           <p>My name is Stephanie Fegel. I am pursuing an English degree at UMass Amherst. My goal is to attend law school after I graduate.</p>
           <h2>More about me...</h2>
           <p>I study English at the <a href="https://www.umass.edu/"> University of Massachusetts Amherst.</a> This has allowed me to cultivate strong analytical and writing skills essential to working with complicated legal documents. Through writing classes, I have gained experience proofreading and editing written materials.</p>
           <p>I also have experience working with legal professionals. I attended a two-week program in London dedicated to educating youth about different legal careers. This experience has allowed me to gain collaborative skills as I spent time completing projects with my peers throughout the program. I learned valuable information about working in the legal field, and that has only heightened my interest.</p>
           <p>I have also taken a legal studies course which has been useful in preparing me for work. I developed analytical skills through analyzing legal frameworks as well as conducting research. I seek to gain as much experience as possible and learn from professionals that are willing to pass on their knowledge.</p>
           <p>I would love to hear from you. <a href="mailto:s.fegel.16@gmail.com"> Feel free to reach out.</a> </p>
